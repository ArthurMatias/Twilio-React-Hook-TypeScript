[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/twilio/twilio-video-app-react.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/twilio/twilio-video-app-react)

## What is it

This application demonstrates a multi-party video application built with [twilio-video.js](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* Deploy to [Twilio Serverless](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions-assets-api) in just a few minutes
* No other infrastructure is required
* No code changes are required before your first deploy

### Running a local token server

This application requires an access token to connect to a Room. The included local token [server](server.js) provides the application with access tokens. Perform the following steps to setup the local token server:

- Create an account in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
- Click on 'Settings' and take note of your Account SID.
- Create a new API Key in the [API Keys Section](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/project/api-keys) under Programmable Video Tools in the Twilio Console. Take note of the SID and Secret of the new API key.
- Store your Account SID, API Key SID, and API Key Secret in a new file called `.env` in the root level of the application (example below).

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_API_KEY_SID=SKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

### Tests

This application has unit tests (using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)) and E2E tests (using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)). You can run the tests with the following scripts.

#### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with

    $ npm test

This will run all unit tests with Jest and output the results to the console.



### Configuration

The `connect` function from the SDK accepts a [configuration object](https://media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/js/video/releases/2.0.0/docs/global.html#ConnectOptions). The configuration object for this application can be found in [src/index.ts](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/blob/master/src/index.tsx#L20). In this object, we 1) enable dominant speaker detection, 2) enable the network quality API, and 3) supply various options to configure the [bandwidth profile](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/tutorials/using-bandwidth-profile-api).

#### Track Priority Settings

This application dynamically changes the priority of remote video tracks to provide an optimal collaboration experience. Any video track that will be displayed in the main video area will have `track.setPriority('high')` called on it (see the [VideoTrack](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/blob/master/src/components/VideoTrack/VideoTrack.tsx#L25) component) when the component is mounted. This higher priority enables the track to be rendered at a high resolution. `track.setPriority(null)` is called when the component is unmounted so that the track's priority is set to its publish priority (low).

### Google Authentication using Firebase (optional)

This application can be configured to authenticate users before they use the app. Once users have signed into the app with their Google credentials, their Firebase ID Token will be included in the Authorization header of the HTTP request that is used to obtain an access token. The Firebase ID Token can then be [verified](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens) by the server that dispenses access tokens for connecting to a room. 

See [.env.example](.env.example) for an explanation of the environment variables that must be set to enable Google authentication.
